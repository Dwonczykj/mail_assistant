# Scalable Async Logging Solution Plan

## 1. Define the Logging Abstraction (Interface)
- [x] **Create a Logger Interface**
  - [x] Defined an interface (e.g., `ILogger`) that outlines the common logging methods: `debug()`, `info()`, `warn()`, `error()`.
  - [x] Ensured the interface accepts additional metadata to support context-aware logging.
  - [x] Example provided in `src/lib/logger/ILogger.ts`.

## 2. Implement a Base Logger Using Winston
- [x] **Install Winston and Related Packages**
  - [x] Installed `winston` and `winston-daily-rotate-file`.
- [x] **Create a Winston Logger Wrapper**
  - [x] Implemented `WinstonLogger` in `src/lib/logger/WinstonLogger.ts` with multiple transports.
  - [x] Used asynchronous logging as supported by Winston.

## 3. Leverage Dependency Injection for Logger Configuration
- [x] **Setup a DI Container**
  - [x] Registered `WinstonLogger` as the `ILogger` provider using TSyringe in `src/container.ts`.
- [x] **Inject Logger into Application Components**
  - [x] Components can now receive the logger via constructor injection.

## 4. Design for Scalability and Extensibility
- [ ] **Support Multiple Logger Transports**
  - [ ] Abstract additional transports as needed.
- [x] **Asynchronous and Non-Blocking**
  - [x] Winston logger uses asynchronous methods.

## 5. Testing the Logging Solution
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write tests for `WinstonLogger` (e.g., using a mock transport).
- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Validate DI configuration and asynchronous behavior.

## 6. Configure Log Rotation and Monitoring
- [x] **Log Rotation**
  - [x] Configured daily rotation via `winston-daily-rotate-file`.

## 7. Documentation and Best Practices
- [ ] **Document the Logger Interface and Implementation**
  - [ ] Write documentation on adding new transports.
- [ ] **Adopt Logging Standards**
  - [ ] Establish logging levels and best practices.
